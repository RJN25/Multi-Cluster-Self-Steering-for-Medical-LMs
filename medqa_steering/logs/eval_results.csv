Question:
A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?

Options:
A) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report
B) Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake
C) Report the physician to the ethics committee

<answer>A</answer>
<analysis>The chemotherapy regimen for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder often includes drugs like cisplatin, which can cause ototoxicity leading to sensorineural hearing loss. Cisplatin works by cross-linking DNA, which can lead to cell death but also has side effects such as damage to the auditory nerve and cochlea, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. This aligns with option A, inhibition of proteasome, being incorrect, and options B and D being less relevant to ototoxicity. Option C, generation of free radicals, is also plausible as some chemotherapeutic agents generate reactive oxygen species that can damage cells, including those in the ear. However, the primary mechanism of ototoxicity from cisplatin is its DNA cross-linking action.</analysis>

<analysis>The patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes and sneezing suggest allergic conjunctivitis. Given his history of similar episodes around springtime and the presence of conjunctival injection and watery discharge, erythromycin ointment (option A) is the most appropriate treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis, which can be a complication of allergic conjunctivitis. However, since no bacterial infection is confirmed, the most likely diagnosis is allergic conjunctivitis, making erythromycin ointment less suitable. Ketotifen (option B) is an antihistamine that can help reduce allergy symptoms, making it a good choice. Warm compresses (option C) are not typically used for allergic conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone (option D) is a steroid, which is not indicated for allergic conjunctivitis unless there is evidence of significant inflammation or secondary infection.</analysis>

<analysis>The patient's symptoms, including progressive worsening chest pain, nausea, diaphoresis, and marked distress, suggest a potential acute coronary syndrome or other serious cardiac event. While reassurance can be helpful, it is not the first step in managing this patient who appears to be in significant distress and may have an unstable condition. Continuous monitoring is also important, but it does not address the immediate need for intervention. Administration of beta-blockers like propranolol (option C) or labetalol (option B) could potentially help manage symptoms by reducing heart rate and blood pressure, but these are not the first line of action. Diltiazem (option A) is a calcium channel blocker and would be used for different conditions such as angina, but not for immediate stabilization of a patient in distress. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step is reassurance and continuous monitoring until further diagnostic tests can be performed to rule out life-threatening conditions.</analysis>

A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack.

Question:
A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?

Options:
A) Indomethacin +/- omeprazole
B) Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole
C) Pericardiocentesis

<analysis>The patient's symptoms, including sharp chest pain that worsens with lying down and improves with leaning forward, along with the characteristic scratchy sound heard on auscultation, suggest a diagnosis of pericarditis. Given the patient's history of smoking and occasional alcohol use, pericarditis is a plausible cause. Indomethacin, an NSAID, and omeprazole, an acid suppressant, are commonly used to treat pericarditis. Colchicine may be added if there is significant inflammation or if the patient has a history of gout.</analysis>

Question:
A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as ""a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)–diffuse large B cell variant"".

<analysis>The patient's history of extensive travel to Africa, along with her 30-pack-year history of smoking, could contribute to her condition. However, the most significant risk factor identified in the pathology report is the diffuse large B cell variant of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is more commonly associated with previous radiation therapy or certain types of infections. The patient's history of breast cancer, while concerning, does not directly correlate with the current lymphoma diagnosis. Her recent observation of enlarged lymph nodes and the presence of a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla further support the suspicion of lymphoma. Travel to Africa may increase her risk of opportunistic infections, but it is not the primary cause of the lymphoma. Smoking is known to be a risk factor for various cancers, including lymphomas, but it is less specific to the type of lymphoma described here. </analysis>

<analysis>The high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border is a classic finding associated with 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome). This condition often presents with respiratory issues, feeding difficulties, and hypocalcemia, which can lead to muscle weakness and lethargy. The patient's history of being born by cesarean section and having a normal APGAR score does not rule out the diagnosis, as these factors are not specific to DiGeorge syndrome.

The other options do not typically present with such a characteristic murmur or the same constellation of symptoms: deletion of genes on chromosome 7, lithium exposure, and maternal alcohol consumption are not commonly linked to the specific findings described.</analysis>

This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of many drugs, including oral contraceptives. The induction of CYP3A4 can lead to an increase in the metabolism of the hormones in oral contraceptives, resulting in their breakdown and reduced bioavailability. Consequently, the levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone in the bloodstream decrease, rendering the oral contraceptives ineffective in preventing pregnancy.</analysis>

Coagulase-negative staphylococci can cause severe infections, but doxycycline is not typically used for treating these organisms. However, it is often used empirically in cases of suspected or confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection, which is why doxycycline might be considered in this context. Given the patient's recent history of meningitis and current symptoms, doxycycline could be a reasonable choice if S. aureus is suspected. However, without specific culture results, it's important to note that doxycycline is not the first-line antibiotic for coagulase-negative staphylococci.

<answer>A</answer>
<analysis>The patient's presentation of bilateral joint swelling, difficulty walking, back pain, nail pitting, and improvement in symptoms with rest are consistent with psoriatic arthritis. The presence of dandruff (a symptom of psoriasis) further supports this diagnosis. Psoriatic arthritis often affects the distal interphalangeal joints (nails are closer to these joints), leading to nail changes such as pitting. While rheumatoid arthritis can cause similar symptoms, the nail changes are more specific to psoriatic arthritis. </analysis>

Question:
A 53-year-old man with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma is enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel chemotherapeutic agent that his physician believes may be beneficial to his condition. The novel drug was previously tested in a small population and is now undergoing a larger phase 3 trial in preparation for FDA approval. A dose-response trial had the following results:

10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement
20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement
30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement
40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement

The same trial also had the following safety profile:

20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment related adverse event
40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event
60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event
80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event
100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event

<analysis> To determine the therapeutic index, we need to calculate both the efficacy (percentage of patients showing improvement) and the toxicity (percentage of patients experiencing adverse events). We can then use these values to find the ratio, which represents the therapeutic index.

For the 20 mg dose:
Efficacy: 19/49 = 0.390 or 39%
Toxicity: 5/49 = 0.102 or 10.2%

For the 40 mg dose:
Efficacy: 46/51 = 0.902 or 90.2%
Toxicity: 11/51 = 0.215 or 21.5%

We can see that as the dose increases, the efficacy improves significantly while the toxicity remains relatively low. The therapeutic index is calculated by dividing the efficacy by the toxicity. 

For the 20 mg dose:
Therapeutic Index = Efficacy / Toxicity = 0.390 / 0.102 ≈ 3.82

A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress.

<analysis>The patient's symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic heaviness, along with her obesity and type II diabetes, suggest the possibility of adenomyosis or endometriosis. Both conditions can lead to a globular uterus that feels larger than its gestational age. Given the patient's history of multiple pregnancies and deliveries, adenomyosis is more likely. However, without a pelvic examination, it's impossible to confirm this without ruling out other causes like fibroids or endometrial hyperplasia. The presence of an adnexal mass would be less common in this context, and no remarkable physical exam finding rules out these possibilities.

<analysis>The correct process involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli is the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells. Surfactant is crucial for maintaining alveolar stability and preventing collapse during exhalation. When alveoli are damaged, these cells proliferate to restore the alveolar surface tension and prevent ARDS progression. However, the other options do not directly contribute to this specific regenerative process: sweeping of debris by ciliated cells and excess mucus production by goblet cells are more related to the inflammatory response rather than repair mechanisms. Club cells, while important for other aspects of alveolar health, do not specifically regenerate the alveolar lining in response to injury.

<analysis>The patient's presentation includes features suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy, such as altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and asterixis. Given the patient's history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in this setting. The elevated ammonia levels (100 µg/dL) further support this diagnosis. SBP occurs when bacteria enter the peritoneal space through leaky gut or portal hypertension, leading to increased ammonia production and exacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy.</analysis>

Question:
A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?

Options:
A) Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen
B) Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen

<analysis>The patient's symptoms, including unintentional weight loss, hyperthermia, and a fine tremor, are suggestive of hyperthyroidism. The presence of a fine tremor in the hands, especially when the arms are outstretched, is a classic sign of hyperthyroidism. Glucocorticoids like prednisone are often used to treat hyperthyroidism by suppressing the immune system's response to thyroid hormones, thereby reducing symptoms such as the tremor and hypermetabolic state. While other options like methimazole or propranolol can be used in hyperthyroidism management, glucocorticoids are typically the first-line treatment for the tremor and other symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.</analysis>

Given the severity of the injury, an interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets is the most appropriate definitive surgical approach to repair the myocardial defect and prevent tamponade. While needle thoracostomy may be used for initial decompression, it is not a definitive repair for a full-thickness myocardial injury. Cardiac transplant is an extreme measure that would only be considered if the patient were otherwise healthy and there was no other viable option.

<analysis>The patient's high LDL-cholesterol level (186 mg/dL) is an indication for treatment. Elevated LDL cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, especially when combined with other risk factors such as obesity, lack of physical activity, and family history. While the other options like blood pressure and cholesterol levels are important, they are more indicative of the need for intervention than the serum glucose level, which is within normal limits.</analysis>

Question:
A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Question:
A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?

<analysis>The patient's presentation suggests hyperthyroidism due to the low TSH level and high FT4 levels, which are not consistent with a normal pregnancy. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is commonly used as a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy because it crosses the placenta and can be effective in controlling thyroid function without causing fetal harm. Methimazole is also an antithyroid medication but is less preferred during pregnancy due to its lower bioavailability and potential teratogenic effects. Radioiodine therapy and thyroidectomy are generally avoided in pregnant women due to the risk of adverse outcomes for the fetus.</analysis>

Question:
A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:
A) CT chest without contrast in 24 months

<analysis>The patient's presentation suggests Klinefelter syndrome, characterized by an extra X chromosome (XXY). This genetic abnormality is typically inherited from the father. The error in spermatogenesis that leads to Klinefelter syndrome occurs during the first meiotic division, resulting in a primary spermatocyte with one extra X chromosome. This results in a secondary spermatocyte with two X chromosomes, which then undergoes mitosis to produce four haploid cells (spermatids), each with one X chromosome. These spermatids then differentiate into spermatozoa. However, the initial error leading to the abnormal number of sex chromosomes happens during the primary spermatocyte stage.</analysis>

<analysis>The patient's presentation, including the low hemoglobin (8.6 g/dL), low mean corpuscular volume (MCV 90 μm3), and low reticulocyte count (0.5%), suggests anemia of chronic disease. Anemia of chronic disease is often associated with inflammation and can be caused by various factors, including chronic kidney disease and poorly controlled diabetes. The elevated serum ferritin (325 ng/mL) is not typical in this context, as it usually indicates iron overload or active iron stores, which is inconsistent with anemia of chronic disease.

The mechanism of action of drugs that treat anemia of chronic disease typically involves inhibiting the production of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) by macrophages, which leads to increased iron release from macrophages into the circulation. This pathway is mediated through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, the drug likely works through this pathway to improve iron availability and treat the underlying anemia.

<analysis>The patient's symptoms of rapid onset muscle cramps, decreased appetite, and diarrhea, along with his presentation of fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain, suggest a possible metabolic or electrolyte disturbance. Given his history of type 2 diabetes and use of metformin, it is plausible that the diarrhea could be contributing to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. However, the most immediate concern from the lab results is the acid-base imbalance indicated by the pH of 7.25, which is indicative of metabolic alkalosis. This can occur due to excessive loss of hydrogen ions, often seen in conditions like diarrhea, especially if there is inadequate intake of bicarbonate. The low HCO3- level (11 mEq/L) further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the high Cl- level (106 mEq/L) suggests compensatory mechanisms to maintain the pH balance, such as increased chloride excretion in the urine.</analysis>

<analysis> The drug selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head, which is crucial for the power stroke phase of cross-bridge cycling. However, it does not directly affect the myosin head binding to actin (option C). The power stroke is facilitated by the release of phosphate from the myosin head, and without this step, the myosin head cannot bind to actin effectively. Therefore, the most likely step to be blocked is the power stroke.

<analysis>The patient's symptoms, including fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic rash, along with recent travel to Brazil, strongly suggest Zika virus infection. While toxoplasmosis can cause microcephaly, the absence of a positive IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis rules it out. Dengue virus can cause similar symptoms but typically presents with a biphasic fever pattern, which is not mentioned here. Rubella virus is usually associated with congenital rubella syndrome, which would present differently from the described case. Given the clinical presentation and the timing of the symptoms relative to travel to an endemic area, Zika virus is the most likely etiological agent.</analysis>

<analysis> Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which can affect various aspects of growth and development. The primary signs and symptoms include hypotonia (muscle weakness), mental retardation, and goiter. Diarrhea is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism. Umbilical hernia is a different condition that may occur due to other factors such as intra-abdominal pressure or weak abdominal muscles, but it is not directly related to hypothyroidism. Macroglossia (enlarged tongue) can sometimes be seen in cases of congenital hypothyroidism, but it is not a universal symptom. 

Therefore, among the given options, umbilical hernia (option C) would not be expected to be observed in a child with congenital hypothyroidism.

The elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels indicate muscle damage, which is consistent with intrafascicular infiltration seen in conditions like inflammatory myopathies or certain types of muscular dystrophy. While positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies would be more indicative of myasthenia gravis, the presence of CK elevation suggests muscle damage rather than an autoimmune response. Genetic analysis for dystrophin mutations would be necessary if there was a suspicion of muscular dystrophy, but the current findings do not strongly support this. The deep tendon reflexes being 2+ bilaterally could be due to muscle weakness, but the specific finding of intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy would confirm the diagnosis of an inflammatory myopathy or other muscle disease causing such findings.</analysis>

<analysis>The next step in managing a child with nocturnal enuresis who meets the criteria for primary nocturnal enuresis, such as being over 5 years old, having no daytime urinary incontinence, and no other associated symptoms, would be reassurance and the use of an enuresis alarm. The patient's age, lack of daytime incontinence, and normal physical and laboratory findings support this approach. An MRI of the spine is not indicated given the absence of any neurological or structural abnormalities. Oral oxybutynin and imipramine are medications typically used for secondary enuresis or bladder dysfunction, which do not apply here.</analysis>

<answer>A</answer>
<analysis>The unilateral atrophy of neurons in the spinal cord as indicated by the arrow suggests a lesion affecting only one side of the spinal cord. This condition is typically associated with damage to the anterior horn cells, which control motor function. The anterior horn cells are responsible for innervating muscles on the opposite side of the body. Therefore, if there is atrophy on one side, it would result in decreased strength and sensation in the muscles innervated by the opposite side of the spinal cord. In this case, the atrophy is on the right side, so the left side (contralateral to the atrophied area) would show decreased strength and decreased sense of temperature.

Question:
A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever with chills and pain in her knee and ankle joints for the past 2 days. She also complains of headaches and difficulty moving her neck. Further questioning reveals that she had a tick bite on her arm while gardening a few days ago. Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease. What is the next best step for this patient?

Options:
A) Ibuprofen
B) Tetracycline
C) Amoxicilin
D) Gentamicin

<analysis>The patient's symptoms, including fever, joint pain, headache, and neck stiffness, along with the recent tick bite, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Lyme disease. The next best step would be to administer antibiotics, specifically amoxicillin, which is effective against the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria that causes Lyme disease. While other antibiotics like tetracycline or gentamicin may be used, amoxicillin is often preferred due to its effectiveness and safety profile in pregnant women. Ibuprofen is not appropriate for treating bacterial infections such as Lyme disease.

Question:
A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 142 mEq/L
Cl-: 102 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 314 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL
AST: 9 U/L
ALT: 8 U/L
24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 µg (< 300 µg)
Serum cortisol 30 µg/mL (5-23 µg/dL)
Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?

Options:
A) MRI of the adrenal glands

<analysis>The patient's symptoms, including numbness and tingling in the fingers and toes, decreased sensation to light touch, and decreased knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid used in chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, can cause peripheral neuropathy by inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization, which disrupts microtubule formation essential for cell division and axonal transport. This can lead to damage in peripheral nerves, resulting in the described symptoms.</analysis>

Question:
A 60-year-old man is referred to a dermatologist by his family physician for management of a rare case of dermatitis that has not responded to standard therapy with corticosteroids. The patient’s medical history is unremarkable, and he is currently working reduced hours at his job as an accountant. Physical examination reveals confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma along the torso and lower extremities (see image). There is also a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm. The dermatologist suspects a malignancy and orders a biopsy. Which of the following is the most accurate description of this condition?

Options:
A) Vascular tumor containing spindle cells
B) Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous–apocrine germ

<analysis>The patient's presentation of generalized erythroderma, confluent scaly patches, plaques, and a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm strongly suggests a malignant condition affecting the epidermis. While vascular tumors and cutaneous T-cell tumors can present similarly, the specific clinical features align more closely with a malignancy arising from epidermal keratinocytes, such as squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma. The suspicion of malignancy necessitates a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

Question:
A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Question:
A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months. Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

<analysis> The patient's presentation of inappropriate behavior, word-finding difficulties, and inattention aligns more closely with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). FTD can affect personality and behavior early in the disease course, leading to changes in social conduct and inappropriate behaviors. Memory loss and difficulties with self-care are also common symptoms. Kluver-Bucy Syndrome, while involving similar behavioral changes, typically does not cause memory impairment or self-care issues. Alzheimer's Disease usually presents with memory problems earlier and often progresses to include other cognitive deficits, which is not the case here. Vascular dementia would present differently, with more focal neurological signs and a history of vascular risk factors, which is not evident in this patient. </analysis>
